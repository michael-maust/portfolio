    recommendation: `Michael is an exceptional young man with many gifts and talents. His drive for excellence has impressed me a great deal over the years.

    Michael served as a student leader in Chi Alpha and used his interpersonal skills to lead his peers in small group discussions. He also used his computer expertise to help craft a very professional website for our Chi Alpha group. I was very impressed with his attention to detail, initiative, and care for making the website unique, relevant, and appealing to those who visited our page.
    
    Michael will be an absolute asset to your organization or business. I highly, highly recommend this talented, driven, professional, charismatic, and humble gentleman to you.`,

    name: "Cris Hanson",
    position: "Engineering Laboratory Director at College of the Ozarks",
    recommendation: `Michael worked for me as a student worker and was also a student of mine.

    Michael provided leadership for my student worker team. His knowledge and skills were evident and led to fellow workers seeking him for help. Michael will make a decision and will keep things productive. Of course, these decisions weigh the various project drivers and influencers. Michael took the initiative to drive the direction, training, and organization of the student worker team.
    
    Michael set up processes and systems for engineering classes, equipment, and operations. He has strong project management skills as well as organizational skills. Michael learned how to use our new lobby electronic display monitor then trained others and developed the content. He also took the initiative to learn the system then trained others on our new 3-D scanner. This includes developing applications used for coursework.
    
    Continuing on Michael's project management and organizational skills, Michael created and documented training day materials - the proof of his effectiveness was that training day ran flawlessly without the work supervisor. Michaelâ€™s capabilities were also recognized by professors - he was a popular request for participation and/or support.
    
    Michael developed systems for day-to-day operations with timing, definition, and accountability. Software implementation for the engineering student worker team operation included ClickUp, Airtable, and SharePoint. Michael was the primary driver to implement the LinkedIn strategy for the engineering program.
    
    Michael is not afraid of hard jobs. Two recent efforts were producing a scale model of the college chapel using photogrammetry and calibrating equipment. Michael used creativity to find outside resources and successfully completed these projects.
    
    This might be the easiest recommendation that I have written - Michael is amazing.`,
